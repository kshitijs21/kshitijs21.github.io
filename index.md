I am a PhD student in Mathematics at Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay(IIT Bombay).

My research is mainly focused on studing the Homogenization of PDEs. Currently, I am trying to study the spectral problems in periodically perforated domains. I am also trying to do the numerical study of the same using the Layer potentials
