title: "Quantitative periodic homogenization of parabolic equations with large drift and potential"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
Abstract: 'This work aims to study the rates in the context of periodic homogenization of parabolic problems with large lower order terms (both drift and potential). We demonstrate that the solution is a product of three terms: (i) a function of time, (ii) the ground-state of an exponential cell eigenvalue problem and (iii) the solution to a parabolic equation with zero effective drift. For the latter, we derive L2 rates in the homogenization limit.'
